## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A refusal the owner reads is in Ukrainian

WHEN the app refuses something the owner typed — a сума, a дата, a назва, a form with a choice
still unmade — the refusal SHALL be shown in Ukrainian and SHALL name what about the typed value
is wrong. No refusal reachable by filling in a form SHALL be shown in any other language, and
none SHALL be the internal wording an engine uses to guard its own invariants: a refusal is
something the owner has to act on, so it SHALL be phrased for them.

This holds wherever a сума or a дата is typed — recording, editing, opening a рахунок, setting a
ліміт, creating a ціль — and the wording SHALL be the same for the same mistake, because it is
the same mistake.

#### Scenario: A ліміт that is not positive is refused in Ukrainian

- **WHEN** the owner enters "0" as a ліміт and confirms
- **THEN** the ліміт is not set and the owner is told in Ukrainian that a сума must be greater
  than zero, with no English in what is shown

#### Scenario: A сума that is not a number is refused in Ukrainian

- **WHEN** the owner enters "12 000" as a сума anywhere a сума is typed and confirms
- **THEN** nothing is stored and the owner is told in Ukrainian that what was typed is not a
  сума, with no English in what is shown

#### Scenario: Too many fractional digits are refused in Ukrainian

- **WHEN** the owner enters "12,345" as a сума in UAH and confirms
- **THEN** nothing is stored and the owner is told in Ukrainian that a UAH сума carries at most
  two digits after the comma

#### Scenario: A дата in the wrong shape is refused in Ukrainian

- **WHEN** the owner enters "31.12.2026" as a ціль's дата and confirms
- **THEN** the ціль is not saved and the owner is told in Ukrainian that a дата is written as
  РРРР-ММ-ДД, with no English in what is shown

#### Scenario: A day that does not exist is refused in Ukrainian

- **WHEN** the owner enters "2026-02-31" as a дата and confirms
- **THEN** nothing is stored and the owner is told in Ukrainian that there is no such day in the
  calendar

#### Scenario: A переказ onto the same рахунок is refused in Ukrainian

- **WHEN** the owner records a переказ choosing one рахунок as both the one the money left and
  the one it arrived at
- **THEN** nothing is stored and the owner is told in Ukrainian that a переказ connects two
  different рахунки, with no English in what is shown
