# app-shell Specification

## Purpose
The shell around the screens: what the owner meets when the app is launched, before Головний or
Рахунки can be shown, and the identity the app presents while getting there. It exists because
launching is owner-visible behaviour that belongs to no single screen — and because an app holding
someone's whole financial life should open under its own name, not a toolchain's.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Launching the app shows the app's own identity

While the app is preparing and no screen can be shown yet, it SHALL show its own name and SHALL
show no other product's logo, wordmark or brand colour. What is shown SHALL follow the system
light/dark appearance, and the colour behind the app's name SHALL be the same colour the system
shows while the app is still starting, so the two are indistinguishable to the owner.

#### Scenario: Launching shows the app's own name

- **WHEN** the app is launched
- **THEN** what is shown before the first screen carries the app's own name and no other product's
  logo, wordmark or brand colour

#### Scenario: The launch view follows the system appearance

- **WHEN** the app is launched while the system is in dark appearance
- **THEN** the launch view uses the app's dark background and remains legible; in light appearance
  it uses the app's light background

#### Scenario: The handover from the system is seamless

- **WHEN** the app is launched
- **THEN** the colour shown while the system starts the app and the colour behind the app's own
  name are the same, so no other colour flashes between them

### Requirement: The launch view always gives way

The launch view SHALL disappear once the app is ready and SHALL NOT reappear for the rest of that
launch. It SHALL disappear even when preparing storage fails, so that a failure is never hidden
behind it.

#### Scenario: The launch view gives way to the first screen

- **WHEN** the app has finished preparing storage
- **THEN** the launch view disappears, Головний is shown, and the launch view does not appear
  again until the app is launched anew

#### Scenario: A storage failure is not hidden behind the launch view

- **WHEN** preparing storage fails
- **THEN** the launch view still disappears and the failure is shown to the owner

### Requirement: The app ships no unreferenced image

The installed app SHALL contain no image that nothing references — the project scaffold's
leftovers first among them. Every image it ships SHALL be referenced by the app's configuration
or its code, including any image that exists only to satisfy a platform requirement. Scaffold
artwork the configuration still points at — the app icon and its launcher variants — is
referenced and therefore ships; replacing it is a design decision this requirement does not make.

#### Scenario: No unreferenced image is bundled

- **WHEN** the app is bundled for Android
- **THEN** every image present is referenced by the app's configuration or its code, and no image
  the scaffold left behind unreferenced is present
